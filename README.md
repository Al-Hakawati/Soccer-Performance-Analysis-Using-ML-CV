# Soccer-Performance-Analysis-Using-ML-CV
This research project aims to harness the power of machine learning and computer vision to analyze soccer players' movements, positions, gestures, physiological data, and biomechanics. The objective is to provide detailed insights into player performance, offering strategic recommendations for improvement, predicting match outcomes, forecasting injuries, and even estimating the likelihood of a player receiving a penalty card. This study seeks to advance the understanding of player behavior and its impact on both individual and team performance.
Research Proposal: Soccer Performance Analysis Using Machine Learning & Computer Vision

## Introduction
The analysis of soccer performance is critical for enhancing both individual and team outcomes. This research project proposes a novel approach to performance analysis by integrating machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV) technologies. By examining various aspects of player data, including movements, positions, gestures, physiological stats, and biomechanics, the research aims to provide actionable insights to coaches and players.

## Research Objectives
  •Comprehensive Player Analysis: Identify and assess individual player strengths, weaknesses, and areas for development.
  
  •Strategic Insights for Coaches: Provide data-driven recommendations to assist coaches in making informed tactical decisions.
  
  •Performance Forecasting: Use predictive analytics to estimate player and team performance in future matches.
  
  •Injury Prevention: Forecast potential injuries to enhance player safety and extend careers.
  
  •Penalty Prediction: Predict the likelihood of players receiving penalty cards based on their on-field behavior.

## Conclusion
